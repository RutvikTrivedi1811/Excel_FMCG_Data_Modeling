# Excel_FMCG_Data_Modeling

## Problem Statement
- The primary objective of this project was to enhance my data formatting skills in Microsoft Excel by transforming raw Profit and Loss (P&L) data into a professionally formatted layout.
- The challenge involved applying appropriate font styles, sizes, and formatting settings for totals and subtotals to ensure the data is presented clearly and in an organized manner.
- This task is essential for anyone looking to improve their proficiency in Excel, particularly in creating documents that are both visually appealing and easy to interpret.

## Project Data Source
The data for this project consisted of raw P&L figures provided in an Excel spreadsheet. This dataset included various revenue and expense items, which required proper categorization and formatting to create a coherent and professional-looking P&L statement.

## Project Description
The project began with the raw P&L data, which was initially unformatted and difficult to interpret. The following steps outline the process I followed to achieve the final, professionally formatted P&L statement:

- Initial Review and Planning: I started by examining the raw data to understand its structure and identify the key sections (revenues, expenses, and net profit).

- Font and Size Adjustments: Applied a consistent font style and size across the entire dataset to ensure uniformity. Headings were bolded and increased in size to stand out, while subtotals and totals were given distinct formats to differentiate them from regular data entries.

- Categorization and Alignment: Organized the data into clearly defined categories (e.g., operating expenses, non-operating expenses) and aligned the text appropriately for better readability.

- Formatting Totals and Subtotals: Used Excel's built-in functions to calculate subtotals for each category and a final total for net profit. These figures were highlighted using bold and, in some cases, different colors to make them easily identifiable.

- Professional Layout: Ensured that the entire P&L statement had a clean, professional layout with proper spacing and borders where necessary. This involved adjusting column widths, adding cell borders, and using shading to differentiate sections.

- Validation and Comparison: I compared my formatted P&L statement with the provided step-by-step solution to ensure accuracy and completeness.

## Conclusion and Insights

Completing this project significantly improved my Excel formatting skills and underscored the importance of presenting data in a clear and professional manner. The final P&L statement was not only aesthetically pleasing but also functionally superior, making it easier to interpret financial performance at a glance.
